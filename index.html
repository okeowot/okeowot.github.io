        <strong>Cuisine Predictor</strong>
        <p>
          This project is a command-line cuisine prediction tool that uses
          natural language processing (NLP) to identify the closest-matching
          cuisine based on a list of input ingredients. By vectorizing
          ingredient lists using TF-IDF and comparing them with a historical
          dataset, the program outputs the most similar cuisines based on cosine
          similarity scores.

        <strong>Sports Brochure</strong>
        <p>
          This project is a Python-based sports season brochure generator using
          OpenAI's GPT models and Gradio for a web interface. It scrapes a link
          for sports seasons, extracts relevant links, and generates a humorous,
          detailed summary of the season.

        <strong>Rainfall Prediction with Ensemble Models</strong>
        <p>
          The data set is derived from the [Oklahoma
          Mesonet](https://www.mesonet.org/files/materials/mesonet.pdf). This is
          a network of weather stations scattered across the state of Oklahoma
          (at least one station in each county) that measure many different
          meteorological variables every 5 minutes. Our dataset contains a
          single summary sample for each station and each day from 1994 to 2000.
          Given the above data, we are predicting the total rainfall for the
          day.

        <strong>Information Redaction Script</strong>
        <p>
          This Python script redacts personally identifiable information (PII)
          from incident summaries using a combination of regular expressions,
          spaCy NLP, and custom rules. It supports redacting names, dates, phone
          numbers, gendered terms, and physical addresses from text documents
          and provides detailed redaction statistics.

        <strong>Norman Police Incident</strong>
        <p>
          This project automates the process of fetching, extracting, cleaning,
          and storing incident reports from PDF files provided by the Norman
          Police Department. The tool parses structured data such as date/time,
          incident number, location, type, and report ID, and stores it in a
          SQLite database for easy querying and analysis.
